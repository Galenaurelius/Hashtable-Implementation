# Hashtable-Implementation
Use of a self-implemented hashtable to solve a word puzzle.

Given a dictionary of words (words.txt is provided as an example), the program will find all valid words in a word grid of any dimensions, represented as a string (as in 4x7.grid.txt). This program uses my own implementation of a hash table, using a fairly simple hash function to store all of the words in the given dictionary.

Command-line usage example: ./a.out words.txt 4x7.grid.txt
